# Automobile Data Analysis

This project analyzes a dataset of automobile data to explore the relationships between different features and predict car prices using a simple linear regression model.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Data visualization (scatter plots, heatmaps)
- Linear regression model for price prediction
- Model evaluation (Mean Squared Error, R-squared)

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required libraries:
```pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn```
3. Run the script:
```python automobile_data_analysis.py```
This will generate plots and print the model evaluation metrics.
